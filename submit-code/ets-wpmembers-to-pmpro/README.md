## Description

The **wp-members-to-pmpro-migration-plugin** simplifies the migration process from "wp-members" to "Paid Memberships Pro" (pmpro). Developed by [ExpressTechSoftwares](https://github.com/expressTechSoftwares), this plugin streamlines the transition by addressing two primary objectives:

1. **Generate Ready CSV for PMPRO:**
   - Automates the creation of a CSV file, ready for importing into "Paid Memberships Pro." The CSV file includes essential user data and membership details from your existing "wp-members" plugin.

2. **Export Restricted Content Compatibility:**
   - Ensures compatibility with "Paid Memberships Pro" by exporting and restructuring restricted content. Your existing restricted content seamlessly integrates with pmpro, preserving access restrictions and membership settings.

## Installation

1. Install and activate the plugin through the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Tools" menu in the WordPress admin.
3. Find the newly added submenu "WP-members to PMPro" and access the plugin settings.
4. Initiate the migration process to generate the CSV file and export restricted content.

## Usage

1. **CSV Generation:**
   - After configuring migration settings, the plugin will generate a CSV file containing user and membership data suitable for importing into "Paid Memberships Pro."

2. **Export Restricted Content:**
   - The plugin ensures compatibility by exporting and restructuring restricted content. Your pmpro-compatible content maintains access restrictions and membership settings.

## Compatibility

Tested and compatible with the latest versions of WordPress, "wp-members," and "Paid Memberships Pro."
